* [Unity Native Camera plugin by yasirkula](https://github.com/yasirkula/UnityNativeCamera) and [Unity Native Gallery plugin by yasirkula](https://github.com/yasirkula/UnityNativeGallery). These two plugins are free to use as of the date I typed this README, they allow you to have direct access to the iOS and Android native camera app and the gallery/photo app on the mobile system. If you are making a mobile app with Unity and want to incorporate some sorts of camera actions to take photos or videos, these two plugins will become handy.
